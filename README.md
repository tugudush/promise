# Promise - JavaScript Async Programming Tutorial

An interactive tutorial project teaching JavaScript asynchronous programming patterns (async/await, Promises, resolve, then, etc.) in the context of React applications. Built with React 19 + TypeScript + Vite.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

This repository contains comprehensive tutorials and practical examples covering:

- **Promise fundamentals** - Understanding async operations in JavaScript
- **Async/await patterns** - Modern asynchronous syntax and best practices  
- **React integration** - How to handle async operations in React components
- **Custom hooks** - Building reusable async logic with React hooks
- **Error handling** - Graceful error management in async React applications
- **Performance optimization** - Efficient async patterns for better UX
- **Testing strategies** - Testing async React components effectively

## üìö Tutorial Structure

The tutorial is organized into progressive chapters, from basic Promise concepts to advanced real-world React applications. See the complete [Lesson Plan](docs/lesson-plan.md) for detailed curriculum.

**Key Learning Paths:**
- Beginner: Chapters 1-3 (Foundations and basic patterns)
- Intermediate: Chapters 4-6 (Advanced patterns and React hooks)
- Advanced: Chapters 7-10 (Real-world applications and optimization)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher)
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript ES6+ and React
- Familiarity with React hooks (useState, useEffect)

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd promise
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The tutorial application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## üìã Available Scripts

### Development & Tutorial

- **`npm run dev`** - Start the interactive tutorial with hot module replacement (HMR)
- **`npm run preview`** - Preview the production build locally

### Building & Deployment

- **`npm run build`** - Build the tutorial project for production (runs TypeScript compiler and Vite build)

### Code Quality & Maintenance

- **`npm run lint`** - Run ESLint to check for code issues in tutorial examples
- **`npm run lint:fix`** - Run ESLint and automatically fix issues where possible
- **`npm run format`** - Format all files using Prettier (maintains consistent tutorial code style)
- **`npm run format:check`** - Check if files are properly formatted (without making changes)
- **`npm run lf`** - Run both lint:fix and format in sequence (shortcut for code cleanup)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **React 19** - Modern UI library for interactive tutorial components
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript for better learning experience
- **Vite** - Fast build tool optimized for development and tutorial examples
- **ESLint** - Code quality enforcement for clean tutorial code
- **Prettier** - Consistent code formatting across all examples
- **Path aliases** - Clean imports with `@/` prefix for better code organization
